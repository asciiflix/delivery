## Requirements

- docker and docker-compose
- port 8080 and 5000 must be free

## Download

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:asciiflix/delivery.git
```

## Getting started...

We created a simple docker-compose file which contains the backend, postgresql, mongodb and the webclient. To make it even easier we created a start script, that also replaces two files which are necessary to use the project locally. Because the default projects are optimized for public usage. <br>
To start the Project just run `./start.sh`, if you want to stop the complete project just run `docker-compose down`

## Usage

After everything is up, you can simply open the Webclient in your favorite Browser under [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
